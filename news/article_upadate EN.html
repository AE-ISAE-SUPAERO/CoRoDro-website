                                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It has now been ten months since the CoRoDro project began to take shape. The project was initiated by, Jasmine Rimani, a doctoral student at Polytechnic of Turin in agreement with ISAE-SUPAERO. Thanks to the support of ISAE, through the M.A.R.S club and Mrs. Lizy-Destrez, the CoRoDro project was able to begin. The project was selected in the framework of the IGLUNA call for projects of the Space Innovation (former Swiss Space Center). It is a great opportunity for the whole team to collaborate with major actors of the space domain such as ESA, CNES, Airbus and Onera. </p>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/news/Drone&Rover.png" alt=""  /></span>
                                </br>
                                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A team of about twenty students in the master and engineering cycles then started to work at the sustained rhythm imposed by Space Innovation. The project is closely monitored by experts working in the space field, who give out advice and ensure that the project is moving forward.

                                    </p>
                                
                                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The objective of CoRoDro (Collaborative Drone and Rover) is to develop and perfect algorithms that allow a drone and a rover to explore a hostile and unknown area in collaboration. Eventually, the goal is to explore the lava tunnels on the Moon. The obstacles are numerous: finding one's bearings in a totally unknown environment without GPS, managing the energy of the two robots, controlling and distributing the flow of information between the drone and the rover and between the both of them and Earth…</p>
								</br>
                                <p style="color: rgb(231, 50, 50)">The CoRoDro team is determined to solve all these obstacles and has already made great progress! </p>

                            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This team, led by Jasmine Rimani, takes care of organization, testing and resources for each one of the other teams. Today, the management team is analyzing the possibility of creating a startup based on the CoRoDro mission. </p>

                            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Led by Jasmine Rimani (Task planning), Maximilien Dreier (SLAM) and Victor Sustaita (Path planning), these teams aim at creating the algorithms to be implemented into the drone and the rover. The SLAM algorithms aim to create a map that can be used by the rover and the drone. The Path planning algorithms aim to create and execute a path for the rover and the drone to explore the interesting areas of the terrain. The algorithms created by the Task Planning team determine mission objectives, which targets to visit and in which order, when to communicate with the control center and how to behave during the mission. </p>

                        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Today, the drone is able to create a 3D map of the location thanks to its LIDAR technology. The processing and filtering of this map now makes it possible to create a faithful and exploitable 2D representation of the terrain for the rover. The teams are now seeking to enable the two robots to locate themselves in a given map without the help of a GPS, solely through the recognition of their immediate environment. The second challenge of the team at this time is to clearly locate points of interest.</p>

                        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Led by Nicolas Houry, the telecommunication team is tasked with creating a communication system between the drone, the rover and the control center. The final communication is similar to the one on the Moon: an unstable communication, a limited information flow and a simulated Earth-Moon delay of 1.3s.
                            In addition, they must decide with the Mission Analysis team which and how much data is exchanged between the different systems and the control center.
                             
                             </p>

                                <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Mission analysis team </h3> 
                                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Led by Marine Prunier, the mission analysis team is essential to the success of the mission. The team's role is to quantify, forecast and anticipate the hazards of the mission. From battery management to the risk of breakage of one of the robots and from the complete and accurate description of the equipment to task planning, the team ensures the compatibility of all parts of the project.</p>
                        
                                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Today, the team is focused on the description and detection of all mechanical problems and error modes related to the robots. In addition to detection, the team is also interested in the severity of the risks related to these problems and finally the probability of the occurrence of these contingencies*. A second risk analysis is also underway, more related to human risks of injury for example**.</p>
                                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The next objective is to set up a "testing checklist" that details each step of the tests to provide an initial reference on which to base new scenarios and to reduce human factor errors.</p>
                            </br></br>

                                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Based on the team's progress we are confident that we will meet the deadlines. We are more focused than ever on the field test campaign that is scheduled for July. We continue to test our algorithms at the ISAE Supaero aviary and benefit from the advice of the researchers and industrialists who support us. </p>
